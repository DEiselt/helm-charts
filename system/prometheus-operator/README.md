Prometheus-operator essentials
------------------------------

This Helm chart contains only essential resources to deploy the Prometheus operator.  
This is meant to be used by the `kube-monitoring-metal` chart only to ensure compatibility with older Kubernetes versions.  
The upstream stable/prometheus-operator should be preferred. See for instance the [kube-monitoring-scaleout](../kube-monitoring-scaleout) Helm chart.
